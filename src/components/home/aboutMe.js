`This crazy year of 2020 has been a game changer for a lot people, and for me, it finally allowed me to make the jump over to the tech industry. As I am near completion of a 10 month intensive coding bootcamp at Coder Academy in Brisbane and will be looking for a Junior role early February '21. Having experience in HTML, CSS, SASS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node.js, Express JS, Mongo DB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, Bootstrap, Materialize, UI, Heroku and Terminal, however I would love to pursue my options with JavaScript as the base language.

Ever since my time at University of Queensland studying Civil Engineering, I was always told that I should have studied software. And in 2018, I took the leap to build my first web app without any prior knowledge (which is nearly finished) to use for my business. 
I was hooked!! For me, programming filled one of the strongest passions in my life which I never experienced with Engineering. The freedom, creativity, problem solving and teamwork, which when combined, can create something powerful that can better businesses or simply help one another.

I consider myself extremely lucky to have found my passion at a young age and can't wait to see what lays ahead in my lifelong career in tech. Very excited to continue learning and growing, and then eventually training others with all these new skills.
