## Description

I've wanted to make this single-page portfolio site for a while, and I thought why not take the opportunity to practice the new React skills and make it a single-page-application.
If you're here reading this. I know my docs haven't been completed before the site is live, I know that's not ideal. But for my portfolio site, I really just wanted it up and running.
