## Description

I've wanted to make this single-page portfolio site for a while, and I thought why not take the opportunity to practice the new React skills and make it
a single-page-application.
If you're here reading this. I know my docs haven't been completed before the site is live, I know that's not ideal. But for my portfolio site, I really just wanted it up and running. I will fill this README out. I just need a break first please. Stay tuned if you really want to read about the making of this app. I will probably write a blog about my findings.
